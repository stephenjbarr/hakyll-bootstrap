<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
I just decided to switch blogging platforms.  I found myself writing
blogposts and not posting them and that suggested to me that the
startup cost of my current setup was too high, and I was
subconciously avoiding posting.
</p>

<p>
I had in the back of my mind a new setup and this weekend, I needed
a mental break and this seemed like a good use of an afternoon.
My new setup needed to meet the following requirements.

<h3 id="sec-1-1"><span class="section-number-3">1.1</span> Requirements</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Static site. This way, I do not have to deal with hosting or
security issues.  Ideally, the static site generator would be
written in a language that I know and am comfortable with.
</li>
<li>Support authoring posts in <a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a>. This would be a
supermodular in utility for me, because I already heavily use
Org-mode for managing my TODO lists, calendar, writing papers,
taking notes, and citing papers.
</li>
<li>Enable customization without requiring it.  With Octopress, I
felt a bit stuck to simply applying pre-applied themes.
</li>
<li>Allow me to use <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. I am not a designer, so I want to
leverage other peoples' work in this area.
</li>
</ol>

<p>
<a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a> had what I was looking for in a site generator.  It
generates static sites and seems to have an active community.  Its
role is to take content, apply transformations, apply templates and
CSS, and generate the HTML comprising the website itself.
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/23xgzf/thoughts_on_hakyll_vs_octopress_for_an/">This discussion</a> on the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/haskell">Haskell subreddit</a> was very helpful.
</p>


<p>
<a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> sites look really nice, and seem to be really popular.  I
want to give myself the option to customize the site later, (or
hire someone else to do so), and Bootstrap seems <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect">extremely popular</a>.
It seems very customizable, but at the same time it did not take
much work at all to get things set up. I know very little about
HTML and CSS and do not want to jump too far down that rabbit hole
at the moment. I may experiment with the <a href="http://bootswatch.com/darkly/">Darkly</a> bootstrap theme.
</p>

<p>
To get started, I forked <a href="http://www.stephendiehl.com/">Stephen Diehl's</a> <a href="https://github.com/sdiehl/hakyll-bootstrap">Hakyll-Bootstrap</a>
repository, which is a barebones bootstrap-based site generated
using Hakyll.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> needs its own writeup. I have been building up my org-mode
setup gradually since being an undergrad. It manages my calendar,
TODO lists, and everything. I am very comfortable writing in
org-mode, and it is easier for me to write documents with
citations, tables, and equations using org-mode rather than
Markdown. Note, I am using Org-mode to generate the HTML, rather
than Pandoc. This gives me a bit more control over the HTML. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/shake">Shake</a> is a build system. I am using this simply to manage exporting
the Org-mode files for the HTML export, and run the script to
generate the metadata files.

This is where the <code>.org</code> flies go.

<li>Add any necessary tags using <code>ATTR_HTML</code>.
In the <i>A post template</i> section, see that I added a few classes to the table.
This allowed the bootstrap to style these tables.
